# Hi there! 👋 I'm Amelie

By combining **A/B testing, user behavior analysis, and funnel optimization**, I identify friction points and implement data-driven improvements that enhance engagement and maximize conversions.

I am passionate about optimizing **digital experiences through a user-centric and data-driven approach**. By leveraging usability testing, behavioral insights, and analytics tools like GA4 and Hotjar, I translate data into actionable strategies that improve user flows, reduce drop-off rates, and drive sustainable business growth.
